This project is a webApp which shows statements (some controversal) to users and asks them if they Agree or Disagree with the statement.

The webapp will then show them the percentage of those who Agreed or Disagreed and to see if their share the opinion of the majority or if they opinion is different from most.

Functionality.

This part of the project is the server side of the project. The second part will incorporate the client side.

I currently have 2 models: Statements and users.
